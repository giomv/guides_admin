This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project runs in node v18.19.0.

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/guides/1](http://localhost:3000/guides/1) with your browser to see the result.

Right now, you could go to two different guides with the fake data in this project: 1 and 2
